    "1) Describe the significance of AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Amazon Web Service (AWS) is a cloud computing platform which provides more than 100 services to the consumer. It provides servers, storage, development and build models, security, networking etc and doesn't require to worry or manage about the security, workforce and management of infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wide range of service:\n",
    "It provides services in every domain like Analytics, Blockchain, Machine Learning, Satellite and many more which is why it is market leader in cloud computing And its flexibility and user friendly UI give the added advantage over its competitor. For beginners and PoC, free service can be widely used and later with demand, can switch to on-demand paid service. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cost Effective:\n",
    "Organization/Companies switch to cloud through AWS, it reduces cost upto 95%. The added advantage of AWS is company only pay for what they use. If an instance is not being used, then it is not charged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalable:\n",
    "AWS facilitates the high scalability features to users/small business/ large organization as per their need. With the growth of company, servers or storage can easily be increased and similarly as required they can be decreased.\n",
    "\n",
    "High Availability and Reliable:\n",
    "AWS provides multiple region or same region Availability zones back up which make the application or instance available at any point of time. Some service like S3 provide automatic backup facility and some service EBS require manual intervention to set up back up. \n",
    "\n",
    "Security:\n",
    "AWS provides high level of security to the organization or company whose servers and storage are in AWS cloud. Through IAM, it restrict the user to allow or deny the access of service or platform. "

    "2) Explain what EC2 is?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud or EC2 is a web service of AWS that provides resizable computing capacity as per the demand of the load. It helps developer to focus on building and deploying application and not worry of the infrastructure.\n",
    "EC2 is used to launch virtual servers as per requirement i.e. CPU, RAM, manage storage, configure its security and networking. It enable to scale automatically as per peak demand. \n",
    "There are 5 types of EC2 instance as per the requirement of the application:\n",
    "a) General Purpose - It is used for small scale application which requires balance in compute and storage.\n",
    "b) Compute Optimized - It is used for application that requires high computing workloads.\n",
    "c) Memory Optimized - It is used for application that requires intensive in-memory operations.\n",
    "d) Accelerated Computing - It is used for Graphics intensive applications.\n",
    "e) Storage Optimized - It is used for application that requires high local storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The features of AWS is:\n",
    "i) Accessible and scalable on demand with availablity of 99.99%\n",
    "ii) Provide secure environment to compute and run application\n",
    "iii) It optimizes the performance and cost with flexibility\n",
    "iv) It is easy to build and migrate application using various AWS servcies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 types:\n",
    "On-Demand Instance - \n",
    "Spot Instance - \n",
    "Reserved Instance - "

    "3) Explain the working of S3 and list various types of instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "S3 stands for Simple Storage Service. We can use the S3 interface to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time and from anywhere on the web. For S3, the payment model is “pay as you go”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to file folders, Amazon S3 buckets store objects that contain data and descriptive metadata. A bucket is a container for objects. To store data in Amazon S3, we first create a bucket and specify a bucket name and AWS Region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the types of storage class or instance of S3:\n",
    "i) Amazon S3 Standard - It is used for for frequently accessed data. It offers high durability, availability, and performance object storage and low latency and high throughput. \n",
    "\n",
    "ii) Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering - It is used for automatic cost savings for data with unknown or changing access patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii) Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) - It  is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed.  It ideal for long-term storage, backups, and as a data store for disaster recovery files.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv) Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) - It is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. It is a good choice for storing secondary backup copies of on-premises data or easily re-creatable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "v) Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval - It is an archive storage class that delivers the lowest-cost storage for long-lived data that is rarely accessed and requires retrieval in milliseconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "vi) Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval - It delivers low-cost storage, up to 10% lower cost (than S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval), for archive data that is accessed 1—2 times per year and is retrieved asynchronously. \n",
    "\n",
    "vii) Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive - It is Amazon S3’s lowest-cost storage class and supports long-term retention and digital preservation for data that may be accessed once or twice in a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "viii) S3 Outposts: It uses the S3 APIs and is designed to durably and redundantly store data across multiple devices and servers on your Outposts. S3 Outposts storage class is ideal for workloads with local data residency requirements, and to satisfy demanding performance needs by keeping data close to on-premises applications.\n",

    "4) Explain the importance of IAM in AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "IAM stands for Identity and Access Management and it has high importance which are listed as below:\n",
    "i) IAM is a global service and is applicable to whole region.\n",
    "ii) It is the heart of AWS security because it helps to control the access of identities like user, group or role by the help of policy. It authenticates and authorizes the users to use service and resource of AWS. \n",
    "iii) It is a free web service that helps to safeguard the user account and enables to access the AWS services and resources very securely. \n",
    "iv) It provides a centralized control for the AWS account for administering the principals.\n",
    "v) AWS Managed or custom IAM Policy or policies can be attached to identities to grant permission to access services and resources. This enables restriction to unwanted personal who doesn't require access to services or resources that are not required i.e. it ensure least privilege permission.\n",
    "vi) Security is further enhanced by using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) i.e. 2-Factor authentication by using various authenticators.\n",
    "vii) Temporary access to services and resources can be utilized by assigning IAM roles to users or group by using Session Token Service (STS) in case of delegation etc.\n",
