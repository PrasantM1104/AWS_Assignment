    "1) Describe how to link numerous sites to a VPC?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "We can link numerous sites to a VPC through \"AWS VPN CloudHub\" which provides a secure communication between sites. This enables your remote sites to communicate with each other, along with the VPC.\n",
    "It works on hub-and-spoke model and can be used with or without a VPC. This design is suitable for multiple branch offices. \n",
    "One thing to note is that IP address range shouldn't be overlapping.\n"

    "2) What is the difference between EBS and Instance Store, and how do you explain it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "The difference between EBS and Instance Store are:\n",
    "    i) Elastic Block Store or EBS provides block level storage volume for Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance and is independent of the life of the instance. The storage volume is exposed when linked to an EC2 instance. \n",
    "    Whereas, Instsance Store also provides block level storage for EC2 but for \"temporary\" period. It is located at disk which are physically attached to host computer.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ii) EBS volume behaves like raw, unformatted block devices which is ideal to store long-term data. It is well suited for file systems, databases, or for any applications that require fine granular updates and access to raw, unformatted, block-level storage like database applications etc.\n",
    "    Whereas Instance store volume is ideal to store temporary information that changes frequently like buffers, caches and other temporary content etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    iii) EBS volume can detached from an EC2 instance and then attached to another EC2 instance and information is still available and used.\n",
    "    Whereas Instance volume loses the information that moment EC2 instance stops or terminates.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    iv) Additional EBS volume can be attached any time to an EC2 instance i.e. during launch and even during running.\n",
    "    Whereas, additional Instance volume can be attached only during launch of EC2 instance and not during running.\n",

    "3) What are the different types of load balancers available in AWS?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Amazon Elastic Load Balancer (EBS) is a managed load balancer that maintain traffic automatically between EC2 instances, containers or IP address available in one or more Availability zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS offers 3 types of Load Balancer:\n",
    "\n",
    "i) Application Load Balancer - It is used to route http\\https or Layer 7 traffic. The routing decision is taken at application layer i.e. at http\\https header request and it supports dynamic host port mapping because of which, it allows to have multiple tasks from a single service on same container instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii) Network Load Balancer - It is used to route TCP or Layer 4 traffic i.e. it makes routing decision at transport layer (TCP\\SSL). It select the target using \"Flow hash routing\" algorithm and attempts to open a TCP connection to the selected target on the port specified in the listener configuration. It also support dynamic host port mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii) Classic Load Balancer - It is used to route either at hhtp\\https (Layer 7) or at TCP (Layer 4) traffic. It is a connection-based balancer where requests are forwarded by the load balancer without looking-into any of these requests. They just get forwarded to the backend section.\n"

    "4) How does AWS IAM make a profit?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) are offerred at free of usage. However, user/account/organization are charged for using other AWS service using IAM.\n",
    "The services that are chargeable using IAM are:\n",
    "i) AWS CloudTrail - It is an AWS service that logs AWS account activity and API usage for auditing, monitoring and compliance.\n",
    "ii) AWS Cloud Directory - AWS Cloud Directory help to organize directory objects like users into multiple hierarchies to support many organizational pivots and relationshiop across directory information.\n",
    "iii) Amazon Cognito - It is a simple user identity and data synchronization service that helps you securely manage and synchronize app data for your users across their mobile devices.\n",
    "iv) AWS Control Tower - This AWS service helps to set up and govern a secure multiple AWS account called landing zones in case of very large organisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, there is a service quotas for number of free users, groups, roles, policy etc. In order to increase them, reach out to support team who will increase with some charges applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, IAM is only a service for user or its management. Due to its high security, availability, flexiblility and many other features, other services of AWS like EC2, S3 etc. are used in large areas and domain and AWS charges for the use of these services.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how, IAM makes profit."

    "5) Demonstrate the DynamoDB support mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "DynamoDb is a NoSQL database service which provides fast performance for the application and has the ability scale up and down automaticatlly. It is AWS managed i.e. users don’t have to worry about setup and configuration, hardware provisions, replication, throughput capacity planning, cluster scaling or software patching.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data stored DynamoDb is secured with encryption and provides reliability with service level agreement. It also back-up data automatically for safety and high availability. The in-memmory cache feature reduces the response time to microsecond from millisecond and thus provides high performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "It supports key-value data structure model and data is indexed using a primary key that is composed of partitiion key and secret key.\n",
    "\n",
    "It supports GET/PUT operations by using a user-defined primary key. It provides flexible querying by letting you query on non-primary vital attributes using global secondary indexes and local secondary indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also supports conditional operation using boolean function, comparison operator and logical operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "It supports quick in-place atomic updates, where the numeric attribute’s increment and decrement can be done in arrow using just one API call or similarly, you can add or remove sets, lists, or maps.\n",
