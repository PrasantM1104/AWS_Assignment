    "1) Explain the Snowball concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Snowball is a application that is used to transfer terabytes of data outside and inside of the AWS environment \n",
    "\n",
    "Data transferring using SnowBall is done in the following ways:\n",
    "i) A job is created.\n",
    "ii) The SnowBall application is connected.\n",
    "iii) The data is copied into the SnowBall application.\n",
    "iv) Data is then moved to the AWS S3.\n"

    "2) Make a distinction between NAT Gateways and NAT Instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Network Address Translation (NAT) allows resources in private subnets to connect to the internet, other VPCs and on-premise network. They can communicate with services outside the VPC, but cannot receive unsolicited connection requests.\n",
    "NAT has two ways i.e. NAT Gateways and NAT Instances and the differences are:\n",
    "\n",
    "i) NAT Gateway is fully managed by AWS while NAT Instance is created and managed by user.\n",
    "ii) NAT Gateway is highle available and is created in each Availability Zone to ensure Zone independent architecture while NAT Instance uses script to manage failover.\n",
    "iii) NAT Gateway bandwith can scaled upto 45 Gbps while NAT Instance bandwidth depend on instance type\n",
    "iv) NAT Gateway Maintenance is managed by AWS while in NAT Instance it is managed by user.\n",
    "v) In NAT Gateway, software is optimized for handling NAT traffic while in NAT Instance, a generic AMI is configured.\n",
    "vi) In NAT Gateway, cost is dependent on the number of gateway used, duration of usage and amount of data sent through it whereas in NAT Instance, cost is dependent on number of instance used, duration of usage, type and size of instance.\n",
    "vii) In NAT Gateway, an Elastic IP is chosen to associate with public NAT Gateway at creation whereas in NAT Instance, Elastic IP or public IP is chosen.\n",
    "viii) When a connection times out, a NAT Gateway returns an RST packet to any resources behind the NAT gateway that attempt to continue the connection whereas a NAT Instance sends a FIN packet to resources behind the NAT instance to close the connection."

    "3) Describe the essential components of Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "The Essential components of AWS are:\n",
    "i) IAM: Identity and Access Management is a free web servcie of AWS which is the heart of AWS security because it helps to control the access of identities like user, group or role by the help of policy. It authenticates and authorizes the users to use service and resource of AWS. It safeguards the user account and provides a centralized control for the AWS account for administering the principals.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii) Elastic Compute Cloud or EC2: EC2 is a web service of AWS that provides resizable computing capacity as per the demand of the load. It helps developer to focus on building and deploying application and not worry of the infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii) Simple Storage Service or S3: Amazon S3 is simple object storage device that allows huge amount of data storage and retrival from anywhere from the internet. It provides developers highly scalable, reliable, fast and low cost data storage infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv) Simple Email Service: It can be used to send transactional email to thousands of users at a single go, which is not available in Outlook or Gmail.\n",
    "\n",
    "v) Amazon Route 53: Route 53 is a DNS (Domain Name Service) web service which helps to connects user requests to AWS infrastructure such as Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, and Amazon S3 buckets, as well as infrastructure outside of AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "vi) Cloud Watch: It is used to track and collect metrics, set alarms, collect and monitor log files, and also monitor resources such as EC2 instances, RDS DB instances, and DynamoDB tables.\n"

    "4) When should you utilize a spin-up server? Use examples to demonstrate your point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Spin-up server generally means to start a new instance of particular service on Amazon Web Service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we require a Linux based server to host our wordpress website. We can spin-up a new EC2 instance which is running Linux (virtual servers obviously).\n",
    "Similarly, as per the requirement, Amazon has hundreds of services like RDS for database, Elasticache for caching etc to spin-up an AWS instance ."
