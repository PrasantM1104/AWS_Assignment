    "#1) Explain the concept of auto-scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Auto-scaling is a function that allows to provision and launch new instances whenever there is a demand without any human intervention. It allows you to automatically increase or decrease resource capacity in relation to the demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the configuration and preference, the instance is scaled up or down as per the demand load in the instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Configuration includes, what is the minimum capacity, desired capacity and maximum capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimum capacity implies the minimum instances required and this would be always be availbale.\n",
    "Desired capacity implies the instances required in normal. Under this capacity, usually the application runs maximum period of time.\n",
    "Maximum capacity implies the maximum instances that is required during peak loads.\n",

    "AWS CloudFormation is a AWS Service that helps to create and manage a collection of AWS resorces (called stack) by provisioning and updating them in a orderly and predictable way. It enables us to manage the complete infrastructure or AWS resources in a text file or template. \n",
    "\n",
    "All the resources that are required in a application can easily be deployed using templates is known as \"CloudFormation Solution\". And the template can reused to replicate our infrastructure in multiple environments.  \n",
    "\n",
    "CloudFormation utilizes a system called “nested stacks.” That is, CloudFormation  templates being called from within CloudFormation templates. These nested stacks can further be abstracted into StackSets. It should be noted that StackSets require additional permissions, beyond those of normal AWS CloudFormation.  \n",

    "#3) Mention and explain AWS services that are not specialized to a specific location.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "The global AWS services are :\n",
    "i) IAM - Identity and Access Management: IAM is the heart of security of AWS. It helps to control the access of identities like user, group or role by the help of policy. It authenticates and authorizes the users to use service and resource of AWS and safeguard user account.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii) Amazon Route 53: Route 53 is a DNS (Domain Name Service) web service which helps to connects user requests to AWS infrastructure such as Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, and Amazon S3 buckets, as well as infrastructure outside of AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii) Web Application Firewall or WAF: It is a firewall helps to monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to Amazon CloudFront and control access to the content. Based on conditions that we specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, CloudFront responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). We can also configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv) CloudFront: CloudFront is a AWS Content Delivery Network which can easily cached content, like web videos or other hefty files, can be accessed more quickly with content delivery networks. \n",

    "#4) What's the difference between pausing and terminating an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instance?\n",

When an instance is stopped, the instance performs a normal shutdown and then transitions to a stopped state. All of its Amazon EBS volumes remain attached, and we can start the instance again at a later time. We are not charged for additional instance hours while the instance is in a stopped state.\n",

    "#5) Describe how to set up CloudWatch to recover an EC2 instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Amazon CloudWatch is one of the Amazon Web Service. It is a management tool and basically monitors service for AWS cloud resources and all applications run on the AWS platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "CloudWatch can be used to track and collect metrics, set alarms, collect and monitor log files, and also monitor resources such as EC2 instances, RDS DB instances, and DynamoDB tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an instance fails a system status check, we can use CloudWatch alarm actions to automatically recover it.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the recover option works only for system check failures like network connectivity lost, system power loss, software or hardware issues on physical host etc and it doesnt work for instance status check failures. In addition, if we terminate our instance, we will not be able to recover it with CloudWatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "To recover EC2 instance, we need to follow below steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "i) Firstly, we have to open the Amazon EC2 console and go to Instances and select the required instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii) Go to Actions, select Monitor and troubleshoot.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii) From there go to Manage CloudWatch alarms and click on \"Create an alarm\"\n",
    "For creating an alarm we need an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions to stop and start the associated instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv) Then for Alarm notification, we can select an existing Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "v) Click on toggle for Alarm action, and click on Recover.\n",
    "\n",
    "vi) Next, for Group samples and Type of data to sample, we must give an appropriate statistic and metric for our use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "vii) And then we must specify the evaluation period for the alarm. Then, modify the Alarm name if we want to. \n",
    "\n",
    "viii). Finally, we can click on Create.\n",
    "\n",
    "The automatic recovery process attempts to recover our instance for up to three separate failures per day.\n",
    "If the instance system status check failure persists, we can manually stop and start the instance.\n",
