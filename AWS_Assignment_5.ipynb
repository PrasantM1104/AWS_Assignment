    "#1) Describe the Amazon C4 instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Amazon Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2) has a dozen different instance families, each designed for specific applications. The C instances are optimized for compute workloads, with a higher ratio of vCPUs to memory and the lowest cost per vCPU. \n",
    "\n",
    "The C4 family was released in early 2015, and is built on the Intel Xeon E5-2666 v3 (Haswell) processors. The base speed of these processors is 2.9 GHz, but they can also be boosted to 3.5 GHz using Intel Turbo Boost Technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard RIs (Reserved Instances) are tied to C4 i.e. are powerful cost control tools, and their potential savings far outweigh any financial benefit from C5. Further C4 runs on Haswell chips which is approved by US Government.\n",

    "#2) What is ElastiCache?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Amazon ElastiCache is an in-memory key-value store which is capable of supporting two key-value engines – Redis and Memcached. It is a fully managed and zero administrations which is hardened by Amazon. With the help of Amazon ElastiCache, we can either build a new high-performance application or improve the existing application. We can find the various application of ElastiCache in the field of Gaming, Healthcare, etc. We can also easily deploy or run an open source compatible in-memory data source with high throughput and low latency.\n",
    "Below are some of its benefits:\n",
    "i) The cache node failures are automatically detected and recovered.\n",
    "ii) It can be easily integrated with other AWS so as to provide a high performance and secured in-memory cache.\n",
    "iii) As most of the data is managed by ElastiCache such as setup, configuration, and monitoring so that the user can focus on other high-value applications.\n",
    "iv) The performance is enhanced greatly as it only supports the applications which require a very less response time.\n",
    "v) It can easily scale itself up or scale down according to the need.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "SimpleDB is schema-less database and doesn't require to define the structure before the creation of any data. Every controller in the database defines their own structure and link the data to a job. It is used mainly for cloud architecture to track the status of the components where the component of the system are asynchronous and discrete,  and it requires capturing the state of the system so that in case of any failure the user can easily revert to its normal configuration. However, It has scaling limitations and is a good fit for smaller workloads that requires query flexibility. It automatically indexes all item attributes and supports query flexibility at the cost of performance and scale.\n",

    "#4) Mention the benefits of WAF.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Web Application Firewall or WAF is a firewall helps to monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to Amazon CloudFront and control access to the content. Based on conditions that we specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, CloudFront responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). We can also configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of using WAF:\n",
    "\n",
    "i) Additional protection against web attacks using conditions that we specify. We can define conditions by using characteristics of web requests such as the IP address that the requests originate from, the values in headers, strings that appear in the requests, and the presence of malicious SQL code in the request i.e. SQL injection.\n",

    "#5) Explain Elastic Block is a store that sells elastic blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Elastic block store (EBS) provides block level storage volume for Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance and is independent of the life of the instance. The storage volume is exposed when linked to an EC2 instance and is ideal for persistant data storage. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, EBS sells elastic blocks because, data has become the new goldmine, storage of data has become has essential for all organization. AWS provides different EBS volume options for a variety of workloads and use cases which is either backed by Solid State Drive (SSD) or Hard Disk Drive (HDD). SSD-backed volumes are best for higher-performance workloads that require low latency and high IOPS and HDD-backed volumes are high-volume, throughput-intensive workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "The various types of blocks are:\n",
    "i) EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1): It is the highest performance option. It provides high IOPS per volume and a high maximum throughput per volume and is ideal for database workloads.\n",
    "ii) EBS General Purpose SSD (gp2): It is the default EBS volume. It offers high IOPS per volume, but at a lower rate and cost than io1, and is intended for dev-test workloads, virtual desktops and low-latency apps.\n",
    "iii) Throughput Optimized HDD (st1): It offers high throughput per volume and a large volume size, and is ideal for data warehouses and log processing.\n",
    "iv) Cold HDD (sc1): It is meant for less frequently accessed workloads, such as cold data, and provides the lowest IOPS per volume at the lowest price of all the EBS volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Elastic Volumes feature enables to resize EBS volumes to accommodate changing application needs or snapshot sizes. We can also change any volume type without downtime.\n",
